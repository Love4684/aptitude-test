===============================================================================


1. If log 2 = 0.3010 then value of log 25 is
===============================================================================

.. code:: math
 
    log 25=log5 + log5
    =log (10/2)+log (10/2)
    =(log 10-log 2)+(log 10-log 2)
    =(1-0.3010)+(1-0.3010)
    =0.6990+0.6990
    =1.3980

2. The product of a number and its multiplicative inverse is its 
===============================================================================

.. code:: math

   ans = 1
   
3. The LCM of three different numbers is 150 Which of the following cannot be their HCF?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math   

   LCM must be the multiple of HCF 
   From the option 55 is only number of which 150 is not the multiple so correct answer will be option 55

4. The value of x if 8^(2x)8^(-5)=8^(7)?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math   

   The required value of x = 6
   
5. Sameer plant 7225 plants. So that there are as many rows as there are trees in a row. How many trees are in a row?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math     
   
      Number of plants planted- 7225

      Number of plants per row = number of rows

      Hence to find the number of trees in one row,

      we have to find the square root of the total number of trees

      Therefore, the square root of 7225 is 85

      85 plants are there in the row

===============================================================================

.. code:: math 

      The word LOGARITHMS has 10 different letters.
      Hence, the number of 3-letter words (with or without meaning) formed by using these letters =  nPr is given by: nPr = n!/(n-r)! = 10 P 3 = 
       =10×9×8=720.

      Answer:

      2500

      Step-by-step explanation:

      Interest rate = Interest/principal

                          =  4ps/100ps

                           = 4%

      Given that R% (P) = Rs.100 ⇒4%(P) = 100 ⇒P = 2500


9.  `10 Scooters, 5 Motorcycles and 15 Cars Are Parked in the Parking Area of a Market. What Is the Probability That a Scooter Will Leave the Parking First? <https://byjus.com/questions/10-scooters-5-motorcycles-and-15-cars-are-parked-in-the-parking-area-of-a-market-what-is-the-probability/>`_
===============================================================================

.. code:: math 

      Total number of scooters parked in the parking area = 10

      Total number of motorcycles parked in the parking area = 5

      Total number of cars parked in the parking area = 15

      Therefore, the total number of vehicles parked in the parking area is 10+5+15 = 30

      Hence, the probability that a scooter will leave the parking first = 10/30 = 1/3.


10. the average age of the state level Cricket team is 22 years. the average age gets increased by 1 year when the coach age is also included. what is the age of the coach?  
===============================================================================

.. code:: math 

      av age = 22
      total age = 22*11 = 242
      (242 + x)/12 = 23
      x = 34
11. P is an integer. P>883. If P-7 is a multiple of 11, what is the largest number that will always divide (P+4) (P+15)?
==============================================================================================

.. code:: math 

      Given P is an integer>883.
      P-7 is a multiple of 11=>there exist a positive integer a such that
      P-7=11a => P=11a + 7
      (P+4)(P+15)=(11a+7+4)(11a+7+15)
      =(11a+11)(11a+22)
      =121(a+1)(a+2)
      As a is a positive integer therefore (a+1)(a+2) is divisible by 2.Hence (P+4)(P+15) is divisible by 121*2=242
      
      
12. In how many ways can 6 lottery tickets be distributed among 4 different people, if all of the four different people can get any number of tickets?

13. If lcm and hcf of two numbers is equal and produc is 3136,find hcf
=========================================================

.. code:: math 

      The HCF will be 56.
      LCM*HCF=Number
      Since, LCM and HCF are same.
      (HCF)^2=3136
      HCF=sqrt(3136)
      Therefore HCF = 56

14. If the sum of squares of two numbers is 2754 and their hcf and lcm are 9 and 135 then the numbers are
=========================================================

.. code:: math 

      x² + y² = 2754

      HCF = 9 = 3 x 3

      LCM = 135 = 3 x 3 x 3 x 5

      x = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27

      y = 3 x 3 x 5 = 45

      27² + 45² = 2754
      
15. If i have kept six different books on a shelf, in how many different ways can i arrange them? 
=========================================================

.. code:: math 

      Arrange 6 book in different way : 6 !

      6 ! = 6 ×  5 ×  4 ×  3 ×  2 ×  1 = 720

      6 ! = 720 Ways.

=========================================================

.. code:: math 

      20=2×2×5
      30=2×3×5
      40=2×2×2×5
      LCM = 2×2×2×3×5= 120
      HCF = 2×5=10
      Difference= 120- 10 = 110

      log10 9 = log10 3^2 = 2log10 3= 2*0.477 = 0.954

20. If we permute 5 letters of the word 'lemon' in 5! ways. in how many words vowels do not come together?
=========================================================

.. code:: math   

      Given word is "lemon". which has total 5 letters.

      By properties of factorial we know that total possible 5-letter words that we can make using letters of "lemon" is 5! in which no letter is repeated.

      There are two vovels "e" and "o" in given word "lemon"

      say e and o are together then that can be assumed as 1 letter

      so now we are arranging 4 letter to make words which will be 4!

      E and O itself can permute. So 2! is also added with 4!

      Difference of both cases will produce possible number of 5 letter words that doesn't have vovels together

      so the answer is given by 5! - 4!.2! = 120-48 = 72
