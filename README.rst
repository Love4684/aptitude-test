1. If log 2 = 0.3010 then value of log 25 is
===============================================================================

.. code:: math
 
    log 25=log5 + log5
    =log (10/2)+log (10/2)
    =(log 10-log 2)+(log 10-log 2)
    =(1-0.3010)+(1-0.3010)
    =0.6990+0.6990
    =1.3980

2. The product of a number and its multiplicative inverse is its 
===============================================================================

.. code:: math

   ans = 1
   
3. The LCM of three different numbers is 150 Which of the following cannot be their HCF?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math   

   LCM must be the multiple of HCF 
   From the option 55 is only number of which 150 is not the multiple so correct answer will be option 55

4. The value of x if 8^(2x)8^(-5)=8^(7)?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math   

   The required value of x = 6
   
5. Sameer plant 7225 plants. So that there are as many rows as there are trees in a row. How many trees are in a row?
===============================================================================

.. code:: math     
   
      Number of plants planted- 7225

      Number of plants per row = number of rows

      Hence to find the number of trees in one row,

      we have to find the square root of the total number of trees

      Therefore, the square root of 7225 is 85

      85 plants are there in the row
