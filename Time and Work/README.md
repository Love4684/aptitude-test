# Time and Work Formulas
   1. Work from Days:

          If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work = 1/n.
   
   2. Days from Work:
   
          If A's 1 day's work = 1/n , then A can finish the work in n days
      
   3. Ratio:

          If A is thrice as good a workman as B, then:

          Ratio of work done by A and B = 3 : 1.

          Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3.
# 1. A can finish a work in 18 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. B worked for 10 days and left the job. In how many days A alone can finish the remaining work?

      A can finish work in 18 days.

      It means A can do the work in one day = 1/18 part

      B can finish it in 15 days.

      It means B can do the work in one day = 1/15 part

      B worked alone for 10 days and then left the job

      Thus in 10 days B has completed part of work =

      1/15 × 10 = 10/15 part or 2/3 part of work

      Remaining work left = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 part of work remaining

      A can do 1/18 part in one day

      Therefore 1/3 part will be completed by him

      = 1/1/18 × 1/3

      = 1/3 × 18/1

      = 18/3 days

      = 6 days

      A alone will complete the work in 6 days

      Answer : A alone will finish the work in 6 days

# 2. A and B can together finish a work in 30 days. They worked at it for 20 days and then B left. The remaining work was done by A alone in 20 more days. In how many days can A alone do it?

      Work done by A and B together in 1 day = 1/30

      A + B = 1/30 => B = 1/30 - A

      A and B worked together for 20 days + A alone completed the remaining work in 20 days = whole work

      (A + B )20 + (A )20 = 1

      40A + 20( 1/30 – A) = 1

      20A = 1 – 20/30

      20A = 10/30

      A = 1/60

      A alone can finish the work in 60 days.
     
# 3. A can do a certain job in 12 days. B is 60% more efficient than A. How many days does B alone take to do the same job?

      According to the question ‘A’ can do a job in 12 days, that means A can do one twelfth of the total work in one day.

      So, A's one days work is equal to 1/12

      ‘B’ is 60% more efficient than ‘A'

      So, B can do 60% more work than what A do in one day.

      B's one day work is equal to 1/12+60%(1/12)

      i.e 1/12+1/20 taking LCM of 12 and 20, which is 60

      => 5/60+3/60 = 8/60 => 1/7.5

      B's one day work is 1/7.5

      So B can do the same work in 7.5 days or 7 days and 12 hours.

# 4. 4 Men and 6 Boys can finish a piece of work in 5 Days , While 3 Men and 4 Boys can Finish it in 7 days . Find the time taken by 1 man alone or that by 1 boy alone ?

      Let 1 man alone can finish the work in X days and 1 boy alone can finish it in Y .
      Then,
      1 man's 1 days work = 1/X
      And,
      1 boy's 1 day's work = 1/Y
      (4 men's 1 day's work )+(6 boys 1 day's work )= 1/5
      => 4/X + 6/Y = 1/5
      => 4U + 6V = 1/5 [ Where 1/X = U and 1/Y =V]
      => 4U + 6V = 1/5 --------(1)
      Again,
      ( 3 men's 1 day's work ) + ( 4 boys 1 day's work ) = 1/7
      => 3/X + 4/Y = 1/7
      => 3U + 4V = 1/7 -------(2)
      On multiplying (1) by 3 and ,(2) by 4 we get,
      12U + 18V = 3/5 --------(3)
      And,
      12U + 16 V = 4/7 --------(4)
      Subtracting (3) and (4) we get,
      2V = ( 3/5 - 4/7)
      2V = 1/35
      V = 1/35 ×2
      V = 1/70
      1/Y = V
      1/Y = 1/70
      Y = 70 days
      Putting V = 1/70 in equation (1) we get,
      4U + 6V = 1/5
      4U = ( 1/5 - 6V )
      4U = ( 1/5 - 6/70 )
      4U = ( 14 - 6 /70)
      4U = ( 8/70)
      U = 8/70 × 1/4
      U = 1/35
      1/X = U
      1/X = 1/35
      X = 35 days
      Therefore,
      One man alone can finish the work in 70 days and One boy alone can finish the work in 35 days.
